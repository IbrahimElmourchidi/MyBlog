**Blog-api story 001:**

_As a developer I want:_

- New endpoint /login
- expand the user entity with email, password
- create new Auth module that is responsible for:
  - JWT generation and verifying
  - Password hashing and comparing using bcrypt
- always store email as lower case and password as hashed values
- close the feature and push every thing to github
